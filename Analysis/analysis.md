# Diabetic Readmission Prediction - Results Summary

# Model Performance Comparison

| Model | AUC | Accuracy | F1-Score | Brier Score | Status |
|-------|-----|----------|----------|-------------|--------|
| **XGBoost** | 0.681 | 0.889 | 0.032 | 0.094 | **Best Performer** |
| **Random Forest** | 0.636 | 0.889 | 0.015 | 0.096 | Competitive |
| **SVM (subset)** | 0.631 | 0.888 | 0.000 | 0.097 | Limited by sample size |

# Key Results

# Best Performing Model
- **XGBoost** achieved highest AUC (0.681) and F1-score (0.032)
- All models showed similar accuracy (~88.9%)

# Critical Challenge
- **Severe class imbalance** affecting minority class prediction
- Very low F1-scores despite high accuracy
- SVM failed to predict any readmission cases (F1: 0.000)

# Successful Implementation
- **Feature selection** reduced dimensions to 1,185 important features
- **Model calibration** applied using isotonic regression
- **Probability calibration** improved reliability for all models
